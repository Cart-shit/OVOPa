### This modpack comes with the bare essentials.
This modpack comes with very little so then it is easy to mod your game with zero to no mod incompatibilites, if you want a preconfigured modpack, use [Overly Added](https://modrinth.com/modpack/ovad) for your Vanilla server needs.

### Ram limited?
This pack is almost garenteed to run at minimum of around 512MB of ram, with almost no frame drops in singleplayer!

### Issues with vanilla?
Below is an image from vanilla to OVOP.

The default pack for QCXR (QuestCraft) is based off of old versions of this pack.

*Ram minimum is around 350MB but it runs slow.*

*other countries may use Optimisation instead of Optimization, both are correct*
